<p>The Wright Flyer was the first successful airplane, invented and flown by the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, on December 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. It was a single-place, biplane with anhedral (drooping) wings, front elevator (a canard), and rear rudder. It used a 12 horsepower (9 kilowatts) gasoline engine powering two pusher propellers. Employing "wing warping," it was relatively unstable and very difficult to fly. </p>
