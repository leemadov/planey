<p>The third plane, also known as the Wright Flyer III, was a further improvement on the Wright Flyer I and II. It was built in the winter of 1904-1905 and made its first flight on June 23, 1905. The Flyer III incorporated several key design changes from its predecessors, including:

    Increased wingspan: The Flyer III had a wingspan of 36 feet, compared to 20 feet for the Flyer I and 22 feet for the Flyer II. This larger wingspan provided greater lift and stability.
    
    Improved engine: The Flyer III used a modified version of the engine used in the Flyer II, with a slightly increased power output. This improved engine provided more power for takeoff and climbing.
    
    Rudder modifications: The Flyer III had a larger rudder and a modified rudder mechanism, providing better control over yaw.
    
    Improved propeller design: The propellers on the Flyer III were more efficient than those used on the Flyer I and II, providing more thrust for less power input.
    
    As a result of these design changes, the Flyer III was a significantly more capable aircraft than its predecessors. It was more stable and easier to control, and it could fly for longer distances and at higher speeds. The Wright brothers continued to fly the Flyer III throughout 1905, making numerous successful flights and further developing their aviation skills.
    
    Here is a table summarizing the key differences between the Wright Flyer III and its predecessors:
    
    Feature	Wright Flyer I	Wright Flyer II	Wright Flyer III
    Wingspan	20 feet	22 feet	36 feet
    Engine power	12 horsepower	16 horsepower	16 horsepower
    Weight	606 pounds	696 pounds	747 pounds
    First flight	December 17, 1903	May 23, 1904	June 23, 1905
    Notable achievements	First sustained flight by a manned heavier-than-air powered and controlled aircraft	First circular flight by a powered aircraft	First truly practical airplane for commercial use </p>
