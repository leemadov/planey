    <p>The second plane, also known as the Wright Flyer II, was an improved version of the original Wright Flyer. It was built in 1904 and made its first flight on May 23 of that year. The Flyer II was larger, heavier, and more powerful than the original Flyer. It also had a number of important design changes, including a flatter wing camber and a more powerful engine.

        The Flyer II was much easier to fly than the original Flyer, and the Wright brothers used it to make a number of successful flights in 1904. On September 20, 1904, Wilbur Wright made the first circular flight in a powered aircraft, flying the Flyer II around a field in Huffman Prairie, Ohio. This was a major milestone in the development of aviation, as it demonstrated that airplanes were capable of controlled flight.
        
        The Wright brothers continued to fly the Flyer II until 1905, when they began work on their next airplane, the Wright Flyer III. The Flyer III was an even more advanced aircraft than the Flyer II, and it was the first airplane to be truly practical for commercial use.
        
        Here is a table summarizing the key differences between the Wright Flyer and the Wright Flyer II:
        
        Feature	Wright Flyer	Wright Flyer II
        Wing camber	1-in-20	1-in-25
        Engine power	12 horsepower	16 horsepower
        Weight	606 pounds	696 pounds
        First flight	December 17, 1903	May 23, 1904
        Notable achievements	First sustained flight by a manned heavier-than-air powered and controlled aircraft	First circular flight by a powered aircraft
